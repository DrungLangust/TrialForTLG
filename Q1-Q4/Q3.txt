Q3 - Fix or improve the name and the implementation of the below method

 

function do_sth_with_PlayerParty(playerId, membername)

	player = Player(playerId)

	local party = player:getParty()

	for k,v in pairs(party:getMembers()) do
		if v == Player(membername) then

end

A3
function removePlayerFromParty(playerId, membername)
	local player = Player(playerId)
	local party = player:getParty()

	if not party then
		//Additional check if player in party
		return "Player not in a party"
	end
	//Additional check to avoid for cycle
	//Get the member object 
  local member = party:getMember(memberName)
  if not member then
    //Handle case where member is not found in the party
    return "Member not found in party"
  end

	//Thanks to additional checks, we can remove a group member instantly without loops and without accessing the container each time.
	party:removeMember(member)
  
    // success message
	return "Player removed from party"

end
end
