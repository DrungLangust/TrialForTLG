Q1 - Fix or improve the implementation of the below methods

local function releaseStorage(player)
	player:setStorageValue(1000, -1)
end

function onLogout(player)
	if player:getStorageValue(1000) == 1 then
		addEvent(releaseStorage, 1000, player)
	end
	return true
end

A1

local STORAGE_KEY = 1000

local function releaseStorage(player)
    if player and player:isPlayer() then //Check that player exists
        player:setStorageValue(STORAGE_KEY, nil) // You can also use 0. If -1 is used in the framework and database as a value for empty, you can leave it as -1. You can also create a local variable similar to STORAGE_KEY with a clear name for understanding the code or future changes. 
    else
        print("Error releasing storage: player is nil or not a valid player.") // Additional error and log handle for better debaging
    end
end
function onLogout(player)
  if player:getStorageValue(STORAGE_KEY) == true then //Check for existing storage. Changed 1 to true for better understanding
    addEvent(releaseStorage, STORAGE_KEY, player) 
  end
  return true
end
